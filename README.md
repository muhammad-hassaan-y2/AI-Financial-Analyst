Hey everyone! I'm developed a financial analyst assistant. 

🔍 What's Inside:
* Environment Setup
* API Client and Key: Initializes OpenAI client and fetches FMP_API_KEY for the Financial Modeling Prep API.
* Data Fetching Functions: Functions to retrieve various financial data (income statement, balance sheet, etc.) from the API.
* Financial Analyst Assistant: Creates an AI assistant to analyze financial data, but the setup seems incomplete.
* Run Assistant Function: Manages the interaction with the AI assistant, handling different run statuses.

 It's a journey through a project, guided by my instructor Muhammad Qasim at PIAIC
